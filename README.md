# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with the Expo CLI, where the development server fails to start intermittently, producing unhelpful error messages.  The bug is characterized by seemingly random failures, often after a period of inactivity or a specific sequence of actions within the Expo project.  Standard troubleshooting techniques, such as restarting the computer and clearing the cache, were unsuccessful.

The `expoBug.js` file contains a representation of the project structure and code where the issue manifested.  The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential workaround, involving careful management of the development environment and additional logging for better diagnostics.

This repository aims to illustrate the problem and provide a possible solution, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes within the Expo CLI itself.
