The solution involved meticulously reviewing the Expo CLI's startup process and adding extensive logging statements to identify the root cause of the failure. While the exact cause remains elusive, it was observed that the issue often arose after extended periods of inactivity on the development machine.  To mitigate the problem, a script was introduced to automatically restart the Expo server at regular intervals, preventing extended periods of inactivity. This workaround isn't ideal but prevented disruptions during development.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js (Illustrative Solution - Restarting the server periodically)

// ... (Existing project code) ...

// Function to restart the Expo server
function restartExpoServer() {
  // Use a system command to kill and restart the server process (platform-specific)
  // ... (implementation depends on your operating system and how you run Expo)
}

// Set up an interval to restart the server every 30 minutes
setInterval(restartExpoServer, 1800000); // 30 minutes in milliseconds
```

Note: The specific implementation of `restartExpoServer` will depend on your operating system and the way you run the Expo development server.  This solution does not address the underlying cause, but it is a workaround to prevent the issue from impacting workflow.
